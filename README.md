Github tutorial

Assalamu Alaikum, I am Ahnaf Abid (This is the name I prefers), a 22 years unemployed boy taking a B.Sc degree on Electrical & Computer Engineering in Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology. I had a grat passion on how modern machineries understand the human command. This curiosity brought me to this subject (Though I expected CSE), I hope for a better future ahead of me. I see myself as a software developer in near future.
